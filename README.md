KHFlatButton

Flat Button for iOS 7 with background color

I developed KHFlatButton to make it really easy to make flat buttons with a solid background color either in code, Storyboards, or Nibs.
This was modeled off a few other libraries that I've combined into my own to include how I use buttons most often.

*How To Use*
To use this either import KHFlatButton.h and .m in your project or add it from cocoapods. After importing you can use
one of the built in factory methods to create buttons or set the button's class as KHFlatButton in a Storyboard/Nib file.

Feel free to use this however you'd like and any credit back would be appreciated.
